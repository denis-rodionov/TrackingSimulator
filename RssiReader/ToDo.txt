1. Construct office map in code
2. Contruct location map (grid). Automatic algorithm
	Fully automatic: union if location is less than 30-40%
3. Visualize grid
4. Choosing location. RSSI visualization by clicking on location
5. Retrieve measurements
6. Save/Load location map
7. Save/Load radio map


Use cases:
1. Create default grid (locations splited by walls) -> small locations are merged with the big neighbour;
2. Choose location -> mark location; show <network, RSSI> list;
3. Retrieve measurements for location -> add measurement for location; mark location with color;
4. Save locations -> for future modification all locations with fingerprints upload to file;
5. Save radio map -> Only fingerprints are uploaded to file for simulator
